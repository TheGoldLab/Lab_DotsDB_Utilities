# A repository for creating and storing random dots stimuli in HDF5 files
For the documentation, you may visit [this page](https://thegoldlab.github.io/Lab_DotsDB_Utilities/). But I couldn't get the theme to render, so, for a better experience, I suggest you try the following steps on your machine:

## To build the documentation
Open the terminal and go to this repo.
Then, type:
```
cd docs  
make clean  
make html  
```
The resulting documentation lives in `docs/build/html/index.html`. You may
browse through it in your favorite browser!
